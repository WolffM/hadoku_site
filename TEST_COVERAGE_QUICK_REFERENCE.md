## What Gets Tested Now

### Before ❌
```
Request → API → Response ✓
           ↓
           ??? (Black box - don't know what's stored)
```

### After ✅
```
Request → API → Response ✓
           ↓
         Storage ✓ (verified: key format, data structure)
           ↓
          Data Isolation ✓ (verified: no cross-user leakage)
```

## What Now Gets Caught

### Storage Format Changes
```
❌ BEFORE: Silent failure
  Someone changes KV key format...
  Tests still pass!
  Bug discovered in production ☠️

✅ AFTER: Caught immediately
  Someone changes KV key format...
  storage-format.test.ts fails!
  Bug caught before merge 🛡️
```

### Data Isolation Issues
```
❌ BEFORE: Silent failure
  Admin accidentally sees friend's board...
  Tests still pass!
  Security issue in production ☠️

✅ AFTER: Caught immediately
  Admin accidentally sees friend's board...
  data-isolation.test.ts fails!
  Security issue caught before merge 🛡️
```

## Impact on Development

### Now When You Make Changes:
✅ Change API response → tests catch it
✅ Change storage key format → tests catch it
✅ Change data structure → tests catch it
✅ Break data isolation → tests catch it
✅ Mess up timestamps → tests catch it

### Ready For:
✅ SessionId management layer implementation
✅ Production deployment with confidence
✅ Future feature additions
✅ Data migration (changes will be caught)

## Next Level (Future)
