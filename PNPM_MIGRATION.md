# NPM to PNPM Migration - Complete

## Problem
The repository is a **pnpm workspace** (configured in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`) but had `npm` commands scattered throughout scripts and documentation. This caused errors:

```
npm ERR! code EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL
npm ERR! Unsupported URL Type "workspace:": workspace:*
```

The issue occurred because:
- Worker packages use `workspace:*` protocol in their `package.json` dependencies
- This is a pnpm-specific feature that npm doesn't understand
- Running `npm install` in workspace packages fails with protocol errors

## Solution
Converted all `npm` commands to `pnpm` commands throughout the entire repository.

## Files Changed

### Scripts (Critical)
- ‚úÖ `scripts/admin/verify_and_install.py` - Changed `run_npm_install` to `run_pnpm_install`
- ‚úÖ `scripts/update-task-bundle.mjs` - Updated error message to reference pnpm
- ‚úÖ `scripts/README.md` - Updated example outputs

### Configuration
- ‚úÖ `package.json` - Changed prebuild script: `npm run` ‚Üí `pnpm run`

### Documentation
- ‚úÖ `README.md` - All commands now use pnpm
- ‚úÖ `SETUP.md` - Installation and troubleshooting updated
- ‚úÖ `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` - Development workflow commands
- ‚úÖ `workers/README.md` - Simplified setup instructions

### Not Changed (Intentional)
- ‚ùå `.github/workflows/**` - Already use pnpm correctly
- ‚ùå `docs/CHILD_APP_TEMPLATE.md` - Child apps use their own package managers
- ‚ùå `docs/PARENT_INTEGRATION.md` - Child app examples

## Verification

### Before
```bash
$ python administration.py verify-install
‚ùå 'npm install' failed with exit code 1.
npm ERR! Unsupported URL Type "workspace:": workspace:*
```

### After
```bash
$ python administration.py verify-install
‚úÖ pnpm install completed successfully.
üéâ All steps completed successfully!
```

## How to Use

### Installation
```bash
# Root level (installs all workspace packages)
pnpm install

# Development
pnpm run dev

# Build
pnpm run build
```

### Worker Development
```bash
# Install from root (workspace-aware)
pnpm install

# Filter to specific worker
pnpm --filter task-api install
pnpm --filter edge-router install
```

### Scripts
```bash
# Verify setup and install dependencies
python scripts/administration.py verify-install

# Update task bundle
pnpm run update-task-bundle

# Generate registry
pnpm run generate-registry
```

## Benefits

1. **Workspace Support** - Properly handles `workspace:*` protocol
2. **Consistent** - All commands now use the same package manager
3. **Faster** - pnpm is faster than npm with better disk usage
4. **Reliable** - No more protocol errors in workspace packages
